User Dashboard: Each user has a personalized dashboard where they can view their insurance policies, premium payment history, and submit and track insurance claims.

Security Measures: The system incorporates security features to safeguard sensitive user data and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the insurance-related information.

Technologies Used:

C++ programming language for the backend logic.
File handling for data storage and retrieval.

Potential Extensions:

Integration with a database for more efficient data management.
Expansion to include additional insurance-related features such as policy renewals and policy cancellations.
This project serves as a foundation for a comprehensive national insurance management system, providing an organized and user-friendly platform for both administrators and policyholders.
